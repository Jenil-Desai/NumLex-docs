To maintain the quality and consistency of the NumLex project, we encourage all contributors to follow these best practices:

## Code Quality

- **Follow PEP 8**: Adhere to PEP 8 for Python code style guidelines.
- **Write Tests**: Ensure that every new feature or bug fix is accompanied by relevant unit tests.
- **Documentation**: Document all new features and changes in the appropriate module docs and the changelog.

## Git Workflow

- **Branching**: Always work on a separate branch, preferably with a descriptive name (`feature/new-feature`, `bugfix/fix-issue`).
- **Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages that explain the purpose of the commit.
- **Pull Requests**: Make sure your pull requests are reviewed by at least one other contributor before merging.

## Communication

- **Open Issues**: If you encounter a problem or have an idea for improvement, open an issue on GitHub.
- **Review**: Participate in code reviews by providing constructive feedback and suggestions.

By following these best practices, we ensure that NumLex remains robust, reliable, and easy to use.
